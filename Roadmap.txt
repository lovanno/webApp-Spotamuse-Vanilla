Spotamuse
Current Goal: Convert Javascript into Typescript to ensure quality and improve current program. 


Features needed to Implement:

Version 1: Launch
‚Ä¢ Sort Songs (most played, alphabtaical, date created, date added)
‚Ä¢ Global rewind (play very last song) 
‚Ä¢ Play Random song from all playlists (Global)
‚Ä¢ Last Played Personal Playlist (plays last 10 songs)
‚Ä¢ Play playlist backwards 
‚Ä¢ Listen to later tab. This can organize songs by priority, nonessential, eventually. Maybe even add discovery section üòÅü§ù
‚Ä¢ 5 Randomly Created playlists (4 songs per playlist)


Version 2: Launch
‚Ä¢ Folders for Spotify 
‚Ä¢ Better queue grid 


Album Order
‚Ä¢ create preferred order of albums. This button switches between original and the ones you just want to hear. 

Organization 
‚Ä¢ Make breaks for Spotify playlists. (Breaks allow for random songs to be played within sections. EX you can‚Äôt play a song in section 2 if you‚Äôre skips aren‚Äôt broken. Max of 3 skips. Must hold to activate. )
‚Ä¢ temporary playlist through queue. It can repeat if you create a button to cycle. It‚Äôll hit button again and be signaled as the restart.







Note: M = Major, n = nothing serious
Current Bugs: 										
‚Ä¢ M1: Playlist tracks can't be played if cover or song info is touched. | Messing with Z-index didn't solve this issue. Will have to research later.
