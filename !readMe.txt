Spotamuse: Hours										Stack: Vanilla (HTML, CSS, JS)

Hours Worked
• Designing Products and Layouts (2:35 hours)
• Website ( hours)


Objective: Reconstruct and Improve a Web Application (Spotify)

Purpose: This project will show you a glimpse of the processes companies use to improve their services. Everyday, developers are 
testing new features and brainstorming new ideas. In addition, you will learn to use information from a database through an API. 
It's the first step towards backend and becoming a Full Stack Developer. 



Issues: After researching the spotify API, I realized you must have the user log in. If it isn't done, my web app won't work after 
60 minutes. It's ridicioulous but I don't know the scale of the issue. Reading on it, it's due to privacy issues. One could easily 
hack passwords if there was no authorization. Although there is this website that uses the spotify API with no auth, I don't want to 
risk safety.

This forces me to develop an application WITH NO API, which is a bummer. I think instead, I will probably use an API that has
data for fake users and auto generate playlists for these fake users. 



Searches with no Log In's.

Audiomack has auth points. Couldn't use

Requirements
•Must look 90%+ Identical to Spotify
•Must use an API
•Must add new features to original Website



Design Reminders:
Top Left: Do 2 tabs. One for playlists, one for Recently played. 
•5 playlists (4 songs per playlist)
• better queue grid (Build on this and add it below) 
• create a tab to listen to music in future (like check out later)

• Modal for queue system. Need to think of playlists....
Make Playlists into buttons that make background hidden and display 
their songs/UI. 

V1: 

• Sort Songs (most played, alphabtaical, date created, date added)
• Global rewind (play very last song) 
• Play Random song from all playlists (Global)
• Last Played Personal Playlist (plays last 10 songs)
• Play playlist backwards 
• Listen to later tab. This can organize songs by priority, nonessential, eventually. Maybe even add discovery section 😁🤝


Feature List: 
 
Playlist Creation
• Folders for Spotify 
• Sort Songs (most played, alphabtaical, date created, date added)


Playlist Playback
• Global rewind (play very last song) 
• Play Random song from all playlists (Global)
• Last Played Personal Playlist (plays last 10 songs)
• Play playlist backwards 


Album Order
• create preferred order of albums. This button switches between original and the ones you just want to hear. 


Organization 
• Listen to later tab. This can organize songs by priority, nonessential, eventually. Maybe even add discovery section 😁🤝
• Make breaks for Spotify playlists. (Breaks allow for random songs to be played within sections. EX you can’t play a song in section 2 if you’re skips aren’t broken. Max of 3 skips. Must hold to activate. )




Better Queue
• temporary playlist through queue. It can repeat if you create a button to cycle. It’ll hit button again and be signaled as the restart.











Possibly
• add to most recent playlist button for songs. Have one for up to 3 before. Make it draggable. (Stays in order. Can change it w drag)



What's the most technically challenging part of this project and why?











Realizations: 
• If there is an error in HTML markup, your css grid will break.
